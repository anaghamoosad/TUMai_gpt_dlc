{"text": "There are no fixed, uniform value limits for gifts & hospitality and what counts as perfectly acceptable in one country or recipient organization could be absolutely out of the question in another. Every case must be judged on its own individual merits. You need to consider local legal provisions and the rules of the recipient organization first and foremost. And these may well define value limits. You must take particular care in connection with public officials: some countries prohibit their public officials from accepting gifts or hospitality under any circumstances.

As Siemens Collective Action activities include collaboration with other (possibly competing) companies, care must be taken to avoid any conflict of such contacts or discussions with Antitrust rules.

Collective Action is an integral part of the Siemens Compliance System and one of the priority focus topics. This is because it is highly unlikely that individual activities can bring about significant ethical changes and improve the transparency of business processes in the face of the widespread and deep-rooted corruption problem that affects society in general, as well as the public and private sectors", "metadata": "collective action"}
