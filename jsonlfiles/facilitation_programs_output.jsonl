{"text": "A facilitation payment is the payment of a relatively small amount of money or the granting of any other benefit to usually low-ranking government officials, for their own personal benefit, with the aim of speeding up the performance of an official act to which the person making the payment/granting the benefit is entitled. This means that the government entity concerned would perform the official act in the same form and in any event, without payment to the government official (including, for example, granting approval where all preconditions are satisfied).", "metadata": "facilitation payments"}
{"text": "Both legally protected interests must therefore be considered when a situation of duress for Siemens employees arises. A situation of duress is a situation in which employees have no alternative but to make an unjustified payment in order to protect themselves or others against the threat of death, injury or loss of personal liberty. The threat must be tangible and manifest. A theoretical possibility does not qualify as duress . Loss of personal liberty applies where there is a threat of imprisonment or comparable sanctions .", "metadata": "facilitation payments"}
